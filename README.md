> vRO Peekage keeps WDT4vRO's Orchestrator-style workflow diagrams and adds much more. Drop in a whole `.package` exported from vRealize Orchestrator 7.x, Aria Automation Orchestrator 8.x or VCF Operations Orchestrator 9.x, and browse every workflow schema, action, script, configuration and resource element, and recorded run. You can then export everything as a report, diagrams and script files.
